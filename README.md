# Genetic algorithm framework with JavaScript ES6

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acupy/genetic-algorithm-es6.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acupy/genetic-algorithm-es6)[![Downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]

This package provides a framework for building applications where genetic algorithm (GA) is used for solving optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.

The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.

## Instalation

```bash

npm install genetic-algorithm-fw

```
