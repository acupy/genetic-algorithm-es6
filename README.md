This package provides a framework for building applications where genetic algorithm (GA) is used for solving optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.

The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.

## Installation

```bash

npm install genetic-algorithm-fw

```
