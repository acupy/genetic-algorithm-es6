# Genetic algorithm framework with JavaScript ES6
This package provides a framework for building applications where genetic algorithm (GA) is used for solving optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.

The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.

## Instalation

```bash

npm install genetic-algorithm-fw
